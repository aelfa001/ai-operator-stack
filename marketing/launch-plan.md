## 📧 Email Sequence (5 Emails)

### Email 1: The Problem (Day -3)
**Subject:** You can't afford help, but you're drowning 😫

**Body:**
```
Hey {{name}},

Quick question: How many hours did you work last week?

If you're like most solopreneurs I know, it's probably 50+, right?

And here's the thing - you're making money, but you're not making progress.

Because every hour spent on admin is an hour NOT spent on work that scales.

The worst part? You can't justify hiring. A VA costs $2K+/month. That's $24K/year.

And honestly? You'd rather do it yourself than train someone.

What if there was another way?

Tomorrow, I'll show you...

### Email 2: The Solution (Day -2)
**Subject:** The "invisible employee" that works 24/7 ⚡

**Body:**
```
Hey {{name}},

Last week I mentioned the problem.

Today, here's the solution.

It's not a person. It's not a complex system. 

It's AI - but NOT the AI you're thinking of.

Most people use ChatGPT for writing a few emails and call it a day.

That's like buying a Ferrari and using it to go to the grocery store.

The real power? Putting AI to work across your ENTIRE business:

→ AI that captures leads while you sleep
→ AI that follows up with prospects
→ AI that creates content from one piece
→ AI that sends invoices and tracks payments
→ AI that reminds you what to do next

This isn't sci-fi. It's available TODAY. And I'm going to show you exactly how to set it up.

(It's easier than you think)

### Email 3: The Proof (Day -1)
**Subject:** The results from people who already did this 📊

**Body:**
```
Hey {{name}},

I've been building with AI for 2 years.

But don't take my word for it.

Here's what happened when Sarah K. (consultant) implemented ONE automation:

→ Saved 15 hours in Week 1
→ Now handles 2x clients with same time
→ "My business runs while I sleep"

James R. (agency owner):
→ Went from 20 to 45 clients
→ No additional staff
→ "Game changer for scaling"

Marcus T. (freelancer):
→ Automated his entire lead follow-up
→ "Email automation alone is worth the price"

These aren't unicorns. They're regular solopreneurs like you.

Tomorrow, I'm launching the complete system that helped them do this.

Stay tuned.

### Email 5: Last Chance (Day 2)
**Subject:** ⚡ 23 hours left at $47

**Body:**
```
Hey {{name}},

Quick reminder:

Launch pricing ends tomorrow.

After that, it goes to $67 - and eventually $97.

That's the thing about launches - they're one-time opportunities.

If you've been on the fence, here's what I'd ask:

What would 10 extra hours per week be worth to you?

That's what this system can create.

Get it now at $47: [LINK]

Or miss out - and keep doing things the hard way.
